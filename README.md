# Boilerplate for projects

A boilerplate is a type of project template that serves as a starting point for your project.
Boilerplates are useful when you need to jump start a project quickly or when you need a reference on how something should be done.

This boilerplate contains HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, as well as images and fonts.
You can use the boilerplate as is, or customize it to fit your needs.
