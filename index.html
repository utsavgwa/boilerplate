        In coding or computer programming, boilerplate code refers to pieces of
        code that must be included in multiple locations with little or no
        modification. It is frequently used to describe languages that are
        deemed verbose, i.e. the programmer must write a lot of code to do
        simple tasks.

      <article class="article">
        In the late 1800s, boilerplate was literally cast or stamped in metal
        and sent to newspaper presses and businesses across the United States.
        Thousands of newspapers received and used this type of boilerplate from
        the nation's largest supplier, the Western Newspaper Union, until the
        1950s. Some corporations also handed out boilerplate press releases that
        had to be printed exactly as prepared.
